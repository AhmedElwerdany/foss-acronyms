## What to contribute?

### Fill gap

FOSS-Acronyms has a lot of blank space waiting to be filled. Find an empty string in one of the [JSON](https://github.com/d-edge/foss-acronyms/tree/main/data) and fix it!

Pro-tips: Open [acronyms.json](https://github.com/d-edge/foss-acronyms/blob/main/data/acronyms.json) and search for `""` ðŸ˜„

### Add new acronym

You can contribute by adding new entries to the list of acronyms.

- Find a good missing acronym
  - Grab one in the [issues](https://github.com/d-edge/foss-acronyms/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). Issues are filled with good missing acronyms.
  - Submit your own. A missing acronym is an acronym not in the list nor in the issues. A good acronym is any acronym used by the FOSS community.
- Fork the project. [You can use this shortcut](https://github.com/d-edge/foss-acronyms/fork).
- Edit the JSON
- Submit a PR

Thank you!
